# New and Improved MedTrak-Farkle Coding Challenge

## Description

Hello MedTrak Team! Thank you for taking the time to look at my new and improved challenge! Last time I did the challenge, I focused more on creating all the players and getting their individual sets of die and buttons to align with their virtual counterparts. Because of this, I did not have much time to write out the actual logic for scoring the game. Therefore, I wanted to show you all how I would go about implementing some of that logic, so I did so in this version of the challenge.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

## Next Steps

I did not have time to make it completely bug-free, so here are a few bits of logic I still need to implement:

- Add logic to handle 'Farkles' to the dice rolling function
- Add logic for ending the game when a player reaches the correct score
- Fix a bug that messes up the scoring when more than three ones are rolled
